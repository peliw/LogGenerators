# LogGenerators

**Generate Realistic Logs for Testing, Labs, and Simulations**

---

## 🔍 Overview

**LogGenerators** is an open-source toolkit designed to help engineers, security teams, and DevOps professionals simulate real-world logging scenarios by generating synthetic log streams for various services—without needing to deploy the actual services.

Whether you're building, testing, or tuning your logging pipeline, LogGenerators allows you to simulate normal and abnormal behaviors, including service crashes, cyberattacks, and load spikes, to validate your log ingestion, parsing, detection rules, and dashboards—safely and easily.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Modern engineers working in **DevOps**, **SecOps**, **SOC**, **SRE**, and related fields often need access to log data for debugging, testing, threat detection, or performance monitoring. However, spinning up real services solely to generate logs can be time-consuming, complex, and sometimes risky in production environments.

**LogGenerators** solves this by offering:
- A suite of configurable log sources that mimic real-world services.
- The ability to simulate different scenarios—without running the actual service.
- Lightweight Docker-based deployment for quick integration into any environment.

This enables you to build, test, and validate your **log management pipelines**, **SIEM rules**, and **dashboards** with realistic data streams—without touching your production systems.

## 💡 Use Cases

- 🔬 **Log pipeline testing**: Validate ingestion, parsing, and routing of logs in ELK, OpenSearch, or similar platforms.
- 🛠 **Lab environments**: Safely simulate services and test detection rules without deploying actual infrastructure.
- 📊 **Dashboard prototyping**: Build Grafana/Kibana dashboards using real-like logs with realistic patterns.
- 🔒 **Security use cases**: Generate logs for simulated attacks, anomalies, and threat-hunting exercises.
- 🚀 **Load testing**: Test how your logging infrastructure handles heavy log volumes or bursts during incidents.

## 🧰 Features

- 🎯 **Realistic log simulation** for popular services and platforms.
- ⚙️ **Lightweight Docker images** to spin up generators as standalone fake services.
- 🔄 **Continuous log streaming** to mimic live service behaviors.
- 🔥 **Attack and anomaly simulation**: From brute-force attempts to service crashes.
- 🧪 **Testing scenarios**: Define normal, abnormal, and failure cases.
- 📦 **Pluggable architecture** to add more log sources over time.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- ✅ Add generators for commonly used services (e.g., Apache, NGINX, SSH, Syslog)
- 🔜 Add support for:
  - Simulating heavy log load and bursts
  - Simulating service crashes or under-attack behavior
  - Abnormal vs. normal activity generation modes
- 🧩 Pluggable architecture for custom log formats
- 📄 Provide ready-to-use lab scenarios for popular platforms (ELK, Loki, etc.)
- 📦 Publish Docker images to Docker Hub
- 🧪 Integration with SIEM/SOAR platforms for simulation exercises
